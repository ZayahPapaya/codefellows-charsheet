## Team Agreement ##

### Cooperation Plan ###

Our team has the below strengths that we will be utilizing in this project:

Justin: Stress test - testing
Zayah: Debug - Inspect, console.log
Natalija: Administrative - documentation, coordination

Writing the code for our project will be a collaborative effort through pair programming, branching and merging.  We plan to utilize many merge conflict resolutions as we approach this. Specifically, we will be creating a character sheet with six attributes.

Justin will be testing the code with functionality after we write it. Zayah be the owner of the repo and will be debugging it as we notate issues in the DOM. Natalija will notate all the conflicts, resolutions and perform the administrative duties on the presentation template which has been shared with the team.

Justin will work on mastering objects, methods and the ways in which they work together to manipulate data and render content.
Zayah will work to master constructor functions in general throughout JavaScript. This will be accomplished through creation in our character sheet.
Natalija wants to get a stronger JavaScript foundation and will be accomplishing this through tutoring and actively working within the files.

Daily touchpoints through slack and constant communication for things that we do not understand or need help with.

### Conflict Plan ###

Our conflict resolution plan is as follows:
We communicate through Slack what we are trying to accomplish and why so we can all follow along for future debugging issues.

If we still cannot come to an areement, we utilize our RNG function (which we will create) to generate winner.

What will be your groupâ€™s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
Communication Plan
Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

What hours will you be available to communicate? Zayah nights preferred - until 2 am. Justin all day and after class - until 11 pm. Nataija all day and after calss, nights preferred - until 2 am.

We plan to utilize Slack as our primary communication platform, this will include after-hours needs. We will take breaks as needed. Our plan if we fall behind to start with is to communicate when that is a risk. We will communicate timelines throughout the project through touchpoints and we will approach it with an all hands on deck mentality to catch up. Daily touchbase will be utilized for idea sharing or thoughts/opinions/needs to ensure everyone is heard.  This in turn will foster a safe environment to avoid the pitfalls of misunderstanding and discomfort.

### Work Plan ###

Our work plan is as follows:
We will come up with a wireframe to include all parts of the project and decide as a team which pages everyone is to work on.  We will set expectations of each other of when we will have the parts, we've committed to completed. We will settle merge conflicts when we take breaks and as we complete the parts. We will push by end of the day and decide as a team what to merge. We will hold off on actual merging in GitHub until we are all together (usually at the beginning of class) or an agreed upon time to settle weekend work.

Our primary process will be pair or mob programing based on the parts of the project that will be the day's focus after wireframe review. The first page will be to have a code for a blank user input form as the edit view. The second page will include the 6 stats and a dice roll to update those. We also intend to create a event in which the we have buttons that save, load and clear to local storage.

### Describe at least: ###

Project management will be completed as follows:
We will utilize GitHub issues as our project management tool. We will set daily goals at the beginning of the day based on the wireframe project needs to determine the problem for the day.  We will determine through equal workload from the day's tasks who will need complete which part.

### Schedule your practice session ###

We will be performing our practice run of our Final Presentation on Tuesday April 12th as we get to a break point but no later then 3 pm to allow time to make adjustments.

All of our code will reside on GitHub complete with attachements.  The only part not on GitHub, but it will be linked are sources and Presentation Deck. We have created a repository with Zayah as the owner and Justin and I are contributors. Our Git flow will to be to ACP when a milestone is met in our code and as previously stated for overnight work we will review as a team the following day prior to merging.

We will be utilizing a PR workflow with the three of us. Zayah will be primary to merge in GitHub with backup Natalija for any extenuating circumstances. We will merge as needed, before breaks, and by end of day. Aside for designated times to merge, we will communicate it as we need to change tasks through Slack.

### Pitch Ideas ###

We brainstormed ideas and decided to create a Character Sheet for D&D that will display the six attributes. One page will be the initial set up of the character with the edit ability to include name, class, race, six stats. The second page will be the actual display of the stats with the dice rolls and those results. The purpose of the character sheet is to digitize storage and organization of a character or characters that the user inputs information to create. A random number generator determines the dice roll that it would land on and adjusts the character sheet as appropriate. The MVP for our project is to have one character sheet active. Stretch goal is to make multiple character sheets.
